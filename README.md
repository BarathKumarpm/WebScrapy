# WebScrapy
Creating and visualizing a dataset through web scrapy and analyzing it

Web scraping plays a role, in extracting consistent information from authorized websites. It helps create datasets that can be efficiently manipulated visualized and analyzed for purposes. Python provides libraries like Requests and Beautiful Soup to facilitate web scraping. The Requests library allows retrieving data from websites while ensuring authorization while Beautiful Soup helps organize and enhance HTML code. Python Pandas then structures the extracted data into datasets enabling a range of tasks. This paper explores the definition, functioning, stages, associated technologies of web scraping as its relevance to Business Intelligence, artificial intelligence, data science, big data, data visualization, manipulation and analytics. Emphasis is given to the role of Python, in this process by highlighting its benefits and predicting a future with advanced and widely adopted web scraping techniques. The efficiency of obtaining and working with data using Python Pandas is a focus of this discussion.
