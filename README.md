# WebScrapy
Creating and visualizing a dataset through web scrapy and analyzing it

Web scraping plays a role, in extracting consistent information from authorized websites. It helps create datasets that can be efficiently manipulated visualized and analyzed for purposes. Python provides libraries like Requests and Beautiful Soup to facilitate web scraping. The Requests library allows retrieving data from websites while ensuring authorization while Beautiful Soup helps organize and enhance HTML code. Python Pandas then structures the extracted data into datasets enabling a range of tasks. This paper explores the definition, functioning, stages, associated technologies of web scraping as its relevance to Business Intelligence, artificial intelligence, data science, big data, data visualization, manipulation and analytics. Emphasis is given to the role of Python, in this process by highlighting its benefits and predicting a future with advanced and widely adopted web scraping techniques. The efficiency of obtaining and working with data using Python Pandas is a focus of this discussion.

# Results - Data Visualization
Analyzing chess player rankings from the April 2024 from the data obtained through web scraping and data mining using Python Pandas, the provided Python code utilizes data visualization techniques to depict the relationship between classical and rapid ratings. The Bootstrap Plot showcases the confidence intervals for classical and rapid ratings, providing a visual representation of the uncertainty associated with the estimates. The x-axis represents the classical ratings with lower and upper bounds, while the y-axis corresponds to the rapid ratings with their respective confidence intervals. This graphical representation aids in understanding the distribution and overlap of ratings, allowing for a comprehensive comparison between classical and rapid formats. Additionally, employing data visualization graphs such as histograms, boxplots, hexagonal bin plots, heatmaps, and line plots could further enhance the exploration and interpretation of the chess player rankings, offering insights into rating distributions, central tendencies, and potential correlations between different rating categories.
